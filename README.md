# How to restrict the orientation change from sample level for Android and iOS platforms in SfDataGrid ?
In this article, we will show you how to restrict the orientation change from sample level for Android and iOS in [.Net Maui DataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-datagrid).

## Android Platform
The code below demonstrates how to restrict orientation changes at the sample level on the Android platform. The following code needs to be added to the MainActivity.cs file located under Platforms -> Android -> MainActivity.cs.
```
public class MainActivity : MauiAppCompatActivity
{
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle? savedInstanceState)
    {
        base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);

        RequestedOrientation = ScreenOrientation.Portrait;
    }
}
```
